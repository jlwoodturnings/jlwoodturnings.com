        <h2>Slabs and Turning Blanks</h2>
        <p>All of my material is sourced from locally harvested storm damaged trees or saved from being firewood. Once milled and dried (which can take anywhere from 6 to 12 months), I look to see what I can make out of the material. I want my pieces to be organic and tell a story that you'll want to pass down through the generations.</p>

        <h2>Wood Turning</h2>
        <p>Turning is my favorite form of woodworking. From cutting the blanks with a chainsaw, to putting the final finish on the project, there's nothing more rewarding than bringing a piece to life and seeing somebody fail in love with it when they pick it up for the first time.</p>

        <h2>Live Edge Furniture</h2>
        <p>For me, making furniture from live edge slabs is the ultimate way to show off wood in its natural form. Telling the story of finding the tree, milling and air drying the slab over the course of a year, and ending up with something that compliments the wood is why I build furniture.</p>
